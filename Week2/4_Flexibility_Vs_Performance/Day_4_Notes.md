# **The Performance-Flexibility Trade-off in Data Engineering**

## **Core Challenge: Data Shuffling**
- **Data shuffling** occurs during **wide transformations** like **joins, aggregations, and window operations**.
- **Moving data between machines** is an **expensive** operation that impacts performance.
- **Scale matters**:  
  - Facebook processes **100 billion rows daily** and **3 trillion rows monthly**.

## **Evolution of Fact Data Handling**
### **1. Raw Facts Approach**
✅ **Maximum flexibility** with **one row per event**  
❌ **Highest data movement cost** during aggregations  
❌ **Requires extensive shuffling** for analysis  
✅ Best for **detailed event-level** analysis  

### **2. Daily Aggregated Facts**
✅ **Pre-calculated metrics** stored **by user and day**  
✅ **Reduced data movement** through **pre-aggregation**  
✅ **Faster analysis** for common queries  
🔄 **Balances flexibility and performance**  

### **3. Reduced Facts Strategy**
✅ **Compressed activity** using **binary arrays**  
✅ **Minimal shuffling requirements**  
✅ Most efficient for **long-term pattern analysis**  
❌ **Sacrifices query flexibility** for performance

## **Optimization Techniques**
### **1. Shuffle Reduction Strategies**
- **Bucketing data** based on **high-cardinality keys**  
- **Implementing Sorted Merge Bucket (SMB) joins**  
- **Using partition sensors** for **data completeness**  
- **Pre-shuffling data** during **write operations**  

### **2. Performance Considerations**
- **Query patterns** determine the **optimal storage strategy**  
- **Partition design** impacts shuffle requirements  
- **Trade detailed granularity** for **processing speed**  
- **Balance** between **storage costs** and **query performance**

## **Key Learnings**
✅ The choice of **fact data strategy** must align with:  
   - **Analytical requirements**  
   - **Query patterns**  
   - **Performance needs**  
   - **Storage constraints**  

🚀 **There is no perfect solution**—only trade-offs between **flexibility and performance** that must be carefully evaluated for each use case.
