# **Graph Data Modeling**

## **Evolution of Data Modeling**

Modern data engineering has shifted from rigid relational structures to flexible, relationship-focused architectures that better reflect business realities.

## **Schema Evolution**

- **STRUCT:** Represents traditional entity-based modeling with grouped fields.
- **ARRAY:** Provides list-based flexibility.
- **MAP:** Offers the most dynamic key-value structure for relationship modeling.

### **Flexible Schema Advantages:**

- **Dynamic Attribute Addition:** Add attributes through MAPs without requiring ALTER TABLE commands.
- **Unlimited Column Scalability:** Accommodate business growth with scalability.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Use "Other_properties" columns for rare but necessary attributes.
- **Minimal NULL Values:** Reduces storage overhead.

## **Graph Data Modeling Revolution**

### **Core Components**

- **Vertices (nodes):**  
  Store entity information with:
  - Unique identifiers.
  - Entity types.
  - Property maps for attributes.

- **Edge Architecture:**  
  Captures relationships between vertices and stores directional information (subject → object).
  - Includes relationship types and properties.
  - Maintains context through subject/object identifiers.

### **Trade-offs**

#### **Challenges:**
- Compression efficiency decreases.
- Query complexity increases.
- Readability can be compromised.

#### **Benefits:**
- **Natural Representation of Business Relationships:** Reflects real-world connections.
- **Flexible Property Addition:** Easily add properties without schema changes.
- **Powerful Pattern Recognition Capabilities:** Enables advanced querying and analytics.
- **Direct Mapping Between Business Logic and Data Structure:** Aligns data modeling directly with business operations.

### **Visual Example:**

The visual example in the image demonstrates this perfectly through a basketball relationship model. It shows how players connect to teams and other players through various relationship types, each enriched with contextual properties.

## **Conclusion**

This paradigm shift represents more than a technical evolution—it's a fundamental realignment of data architecture with business thinking, allowing organizations to model their data as they conceptualize their operations.
